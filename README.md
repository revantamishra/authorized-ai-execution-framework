# Authorized AI Execution Framework

## Overview
A research-grade proof-of-concept for enforcing pre-execution authorization and runtime execution boundaries for AI systems.

This framework ensures that AI systems:
- Cannot access undeclared data
- Cannot perform undeclared actions
- Cannot execute outside explicitly verified boundaries

## Core Principle
No implicit behavior.  
All AI capabilities must be explicitly declared, verified, and enforced.

## Architecture
The system is composed of three strictly separated layers:
1. Specification Layer
2. Static Verification Engine
3. Constrained Runtime Enforcer

## Status
Early research prototype.  
Not intended for production use.

## License
To be determined.
